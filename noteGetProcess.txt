How It Works:

- getpid() gets the process ID of the current process (the program itself in this case).
- sprintf() is used to prepare the command string that includes the process ID. This command uses ps to show the process ID (pid), state (stat), and command (cmd) for the specified PID.
- system() executes the command, and you'll see the output directly in your terminal, which includes the state of the process.

The stat column in the ps command output shows the state of the process:

    R (running)
    S (sleeping)
    D (uninterruptible sleep)
    Z (zombie)
    T (stopped by job control signal)
    t (stopped by debugger during tracing)
    W (paging)
    X (dead)
